SuperCollider 3 tutorials code
==============================

## Transcripts

These are conveniently contributed by Eli Fieldsteel :) Thanks for that!

## Snippets

These are snippets coded while watching the YouTube series [SuperCollider Tutorials by Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzsOOiJ_p4&list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

Much of the code being produced on screen is played back faster than realtime, the videos are edited to keep narration pace constant and coding error free. Learn SC by coding along with Eli in the videos, and pause the videos mercilessly to allow your fingers to catch up with the code on-screen. These code snippets are reproduced with Eli's consent and I have done so primarily for my own convenience, but if you find them useful - rok on. 

Most code snippets evolve from simple to complex over the course of several minutes. I wanted to keep track of the various stages in-between, and record the occassional comment to reinforce what's going on.

This is not intended to be a transcript of the videos, but some limited sections will have near verbatim reproduction of Eli's comments.
